# Get started

!!! important
    agr is kept for educational purposes and is not actively maintained. You
    are welcome to study and reuse the code, but should not expect updates,
    support, or production-readiness.

Your team shouldn't be copying AI skill files around by hand. agr gives you a
shared, versioned skill environment: one manifest, one sync command, the same
setup on every machine and every tool.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install agr
```

## Add a skill

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf
```

Handles follow `owner/repo/skill` — a directory inside a GitHub repo.
`anthropics/skills/pdf` is the `pdf/` directory in
[github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills).

Open Claude Code and type `/pdf` — the skill is there.

## Share with your team

Commit `agr.toml` and `agr.lock`. When a teammate clones the repo:

```bash
agr sync
```

Same skills. Every machine.
